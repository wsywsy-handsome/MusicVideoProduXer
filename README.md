## üéû Preparing Your `shots.json` File

To ensure stable execution, your `shots.json` must follow this structure:

```json
{
  "character_description": "A stunningly handsome Chinese man in his late 20s, with sharp yet gentle facial features, pale flawless skin, and profound dark eyes. He has long black hair partially tied up in a loose bun at the back of his head, with several strands falling naturally around his face. He wears elegant ink-wash gradient linen robes in shades of charcoal gray and off-white, with flowing brushstroke patterns. The robes feature wide sleeves that billow in the wind. The overall aesthetic is ethereal, combining traditional Chinese elements with modern xianxia fantasy style. Full body shot, cinematic lighting, soft morning light, highly detailed, photorealistic, 8K resolution.",
  "shots": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "lyric": "(Intro)",
      "stable": "Wide cinematic shot, Chinese ink-wash style mountains. Morning mist drapes like silk ribbons around green peaks. Water reflects the sky, ultra-low saturation, serene atmosphere.",
      "dynamic": "The camera slowly pushes forward through the mist, gliding silently as the fog flows gently.",
      "duration": 4,
      "sing": false,
      "character": false
    },
    {
      "id": 35,
      "lyric": "The morning mist brushes past the mountain‚Äôs shoulder",
      "stable": "Medium shot. The protagonist‚Äôs silhouette stands atop a mountain, facing the sea of clouds. Morning light outlines his figure. Black mid-length hair tied into a bun, dressed in ink-wash gradient linen robes, with a thin, wide-sleeved outer robe fluttering slightly.",
      "dynamic": "The camera slowly circles from the protagonist‚Äôs side to behind, while the clouds in the background accelerate, visually ‚Äòbrushing past‚Äô the mountain.",
      "duration": 11,
      "sing": false,
      "character": true
    }
  ]
}
```
